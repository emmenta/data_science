```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
V <- c("Bears", "Lions", "Dolphins", "Eagles", "Bengals")
```

### Question 1
The above vector V is an atomic vector because it has all values of similar datatype - *character*. Atomic vectors contains objects of the same type.

### Question 2
```{r}
V[3]
```

### Question 3
```{r}
V[c(1,3,5)]
```

### Question 4
```{r}
V[-1]
```

### Question 5
```{r}
K <- list(x = 3:7, "never", 43, y = list(10,20,30))
```
The vector above is called a list because it contains objects of different types. Lists in R are vectors that contains a list of objects with different datatypes.

### Question 6
```{r}
length(K)
```

### Question 7
```{r}
K[[4]]
```

### Question 8
```{r}
K[]
```

### Question 9
